My first personal website. Basically it is just a résumé

<!-- "Initial README commit" -->

## About me

### I'm Franco Barreto, born in Chaco, a province in northern Argentina

### I used to work as an application support agent for various companies before and at some point I used to develop small applications or fixes as well as system administrator roles

### I am currently working in a small family business where I design and develop databases, infrastructures and small apps. Focusing on web applications that use javascript and some libraries and/or frameworks. My last development was created using quickjs + tailwind + pocketbase + cloudflare pages. I've also been working on docker and docker-compose to upload databases and workstations

### I love the javascript language and that's why I'm strongly focusing on this technology right now

### I have signed to this opportunity as I still have no experience working for large companies as a developer and to get more experience with javascript
